# Pregnancy Scans: Week 13 vs Week 20

> Research summary — February 2026

---

## Detection Rates

### Week 13 (First Trimester)
- Detects about **45-51% of all structural anomalies**
- Catches **nearly 100% of severe/major anomalies**
- Best for: skeletal, cardiac, and urinary tract issues

### Week 20 (Second Trimester)
- Higher overall detection rate (~50-85% depending on anomaly type)
- Better for structures that develop later (e.g., cerebellar vermis)
- Still considered the gold standard

---

## Benefits of Early Detection

### More Time for Options
- Earlier access to genetic testing (amniocentesis, CVS)
- Time for additional specialist consultations
- Opportunity for intrauterine treatment in some cases:
  - Spina bifida
  - Diaphragmatic hernia
  - Certain heart defects

### If There's a Serious Problem
- Earlier decision-making — less physically and emotionally difficult than later
- More time to process, research, and plan
- Easier/safer procedures if termination is chosen
- Better preparation if continuing the pregnancy (delivery planning, specialty care setup)

### Practical Advantages
- Transvaginal scanning option works better for obese patients or difficult visualization
- Finding issues early means you can schedule the 20-week scan more strategically (e.g., focused follow-up rather than general survey)

## Important Caveat

Week 13 scans **don't replace** the 20-week scan — they complement it. Some structures simply aren't formed yet at 13 weeks, so a normal early scan doesn't guarantee a normal pregnancy.

## Bottom Line

If there's a problem, early detection gives you more runway for decisions, testing, and planning. It's especially valuable in high-risk pregnancies:
- Diabetes
- Obesity
- Family history of anomalies
