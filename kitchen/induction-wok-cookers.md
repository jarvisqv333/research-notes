# Concave Induction Wok Cookers

*February 2026*

---

## What Are They?

Concave induction wok cookers are specialized induction hobs with a bowl-shaped surface that cradles round-bottom woks. Unlike flat induction cooktops, these allow traditional Chinese round-bottom woks to make full contact with the heating surface.

**Why they matter:**
- Proper wok hei (breath of the wok) - the smoky flavor from high-heat cooking
- Traditional round-bottom wok shape for proper tossing and heat distribution
- No gas bottles required
- Used by professional chefs in China

---

## How They Work

- Concave copper coil heats the curved bottom of the wok
- Temperatures can reach 320°C (much higher than typical induction)
- Requires round-bottom carbon steel or iron woks (flat-bottom won't work)
- Produces significant smoke - needs ventilation or outdoor use

## Practical Tips

### Setup
- Plug directly into wall outlet (trips power strips)
- Use outdoors or with powerful range hood
- Allow space around unit for ventilation

### Cooking
- 190°C is typical for stir-frying (not max!)
- 270°C+ for wok hei effects
- Pre-heat for 30-60 seconds before adding oil

### Wok Compatibility
- Must use round-bottom woks
- Wok needs to be carbon steel or iron (magnetic)
- Check dimensions: concave area typically 26cm wide × 5cm deep
- Flat-bottom woks won't work

### Smoke Management
- High heat = lots of smoke
- Trigger smoke alarms if used indoors
- Outdoor balcony/garden ideal
- Commercial range hood if indoor

## Real-World Experience

From Jackie M's review:

> "It provides more than enough heat to infuse your dishes with that sought-after smoky wok hei flavour."

From Reddit users:

> "Holy smokes, this thing gets HOT, and FAST. I turned the dial to max and within 10 seconds I had scorched the rice. Dial goes to 20 and I spent most of the time at 10 or 12."

## Key Takeaway

For proper wok cooking at home without gas:

> **Get a 3500W concave induction cooker (generic from AliExpress for value, or Hendi for commercial grade) + pair with a round-bottom carbon steel wok.**
