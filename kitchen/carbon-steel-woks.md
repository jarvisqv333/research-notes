# Carbon Steel Woks

*February 2026*

---

## Why Carbon Steel?

Carbon steel is the gold standard for woks:

- **Zero coatings** - No PTFE, no ceramic, no polymers
- **Naturally non-stick** - Once seasoned, food releases easily
- **Gets better with age** - The more you cook, the better the seasoning
- **High heat tolerance** - Handle wok burner temps without degradation
- **Lightweight** - Easy to toss and flip, unlike cast iron
- **Induction compatible** - Works on any heat source

## What to Avoid

### Non-Stick Coatings (PTFE/Teflon)

Most "non-stick" woks use PTFE-based coatings. Watch out for marketing terms:

| Marketing Term | Reality |
|----------------|---------|
| "Ceramic reinforced" | PTFE with ceramic particles added for hardness |
| "Granite coating" | PTFE with mineral additives |
| "Diamond/Titanium infused" | PTFE with hard particles |
| "Hex pattern" | PTFE in the valleys, metal ridges for protection |

**Key indicator:** If it doesn't explicitly say "PTFE-free", it probably contains PTFE.

### Ceramic Coatings (Sol-Gel)

True ceramic coatings (silicon-based, sol-gel technology) are PTFE-free but:

- Lose non-stick properties faster (6-18 months typically)
- Less durable than PTFE
- Can be expensive

### Cast Iron

- Very heavy - hard to toss
- Slow to heat up and cool down
- Not ideal for rapid heat changes required in stir-frying

### Stainless Steel

- Food sticks easily
- Slow heat response
- No seasoning benefits

## Where to Buy in Singapore

| Source | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Yosukata Singapore** | Direct shipping, pre-seasoned options |
| **Shopee** | Joyce Chen, Mammafong, generic carbon steel |
| **Lazada** | Similar selection to Shopee |
| **Takashimaya Online** | Premium selection, free delivery over $150 |
| **Chinatown kitchen shops** | Hit-or-miss for carbon steel; many only stock stainless/cast iron |

**Tip:** IKEA's carbon steel frying pan is solid value, but they don't carry a wok version.

## Seasoning Your Wok

If your wok isn't pre-seasoned:

1. **Scrub off factory coating** - Use steel wool and hot soapy water
2. **Heat until smoking** - Over high heat, all surfaces
3. **Apply thin oil layer** - Use neutral oil (canola, vegetable)
4. **Heat until smoking again** - Let the oil polymerize
5. **Repeat 3-4 times** - Build up seasoning layers

**Maintenance:**
- Never use soap (or use very sparingly)
- Dry thoroughly after washing
- Apply thin oil layer before storing
- Cook high-fat foods initially (bacon, pork belly) to build seasoning

---

## Key Takeaway

For plastic-free, PTFE-free wok cooking:

> **Get a flat-bottom carbon steel wok (Yosukata or Mammafong) + season it properly.**

It will outlast any non-stick coating and get better with every use.
